# Ultimate
Set of classes and functions on C++ that I made for learning, routine optimisation or fun purpose
[ENG]: This is a repository made for the C++ classes and functions I ever made for learning, routine optimisation or fun purposes. Because of that, they are kinda non-standardized and sometimes messy. These pieces are grouped by the tasks they perform. However, you can include only main header "ultimate.h", which will take care of including all other code in your project. Also I've tried to comment out all the aspects of each function and class. If you'll ever need this, feel free to use it in any project you want. If you find a bug, that shouldn't be there, feel free to message me on Twitter @___LeKSuS___ (or any other social media if you know them). 

big_int - class used for operating with integer numbers that don't fit in standart data types
combinatorics - Set of combinatoric functions
ns_int - class used for operations with integers in different numeral systems
operations - Set of functions that are used for some binary operations and data encryption/decryption
tools - Set of functions used for converting data to different formats and some other useful functions
